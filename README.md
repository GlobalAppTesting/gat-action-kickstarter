### Kickstart your GAT actions integration!

This repository contains complete setup to launch your first tests using [GlobalAppTesting github action](https://github.com/GlobalAppTesting/gat-actions-request-test).

Test it yourself:
- fork this repo
- sign up for your API KEY [here](https://go.globalapptesting.com/speak-to-us)
- set your API key as a `GAT_API_KEY` secret in your repo.
- generate new access token. See [official github guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token). "repo" permissions are enough.
- set your access token as a `GAT_GH_ACCESS_TOKEN` secret in your repo.

You should also change the description in `.gat.json` to include your webpage URL. Otherwise our testers will be checking [if Cyberpunk's website is any better than the game is](https://www.cyberpunk.net).
